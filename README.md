# **ASTRO NOVA** - Milestone Project 1

Welcome to my First Milestone project, AstroNova.
So...I've taken a leap of faith and enrolled in a Full Stack Development course. Am I mad? Quite possibly! 
But I have high hopes to begin on a new journey to switch my career and become a programmer. Up to this point in my career, I have specialised mainly in Graphic Design, this is ultimately my passion, I love to be a creative and deliver quality work.
The ability to be able to merge these two visual mediums is both challenging and exciting for me.

The purpose of this project is to showcase my learning and understanding of the modules and the languages I have learned this far at this point in the course, while I still have much to learn, I hope you understand my vision.
I'd like to thank you for viewing my Milestone 1 project and I very much hope you enjoy it as much as I have designing and developing it!

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme chosen for the Astro Nova website I wanted to keep fairly simplistic. With the Genre of the website being that of space and the stars I knew very early on that I wanted to go for a "dark theme" however, I wanted to keep the website looking clean and fresh. For this reason I based my colour scheme predominantly around 2 different colour variations, Black and Yellow. I believe the common use of Blacks and Dark Greys contrasted well with the pops of bright Yellow. Using the variations of Yellow also allowed me select certain content throughout the website that I wanted to draw the readers attention to which works creatively. 

![Colour Palette](/documentation/colour-palette.png)
I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/000000-303030-484848-ffff00-cfcf4f) to generate my colour palette for the purpose of visual description.


### Typography

Because my main design vision for the Astro Nova Website was based around a clean and sleek visual I didn't feel it neccesary to overcomplicate when it came to selecting fonts. I wanted something professional looking that was also easy to read agianst the dark theme and imagery. I felt my selected font encompassed all I wanted it to, however I did decide to differentiate some heading elements from the main body text by experimenting with different font-weight's and also adding a text-shadow CSS property and believe this worked effectively while still staying on theme with the main body of content.

- The [Jost](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jost?query=jost) font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans-serif as the fallback font. I sourced this from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons were used throughout the site, such as the  moon icon and mail icons and also the social media icons found in the footer.


### Imagery

Imagery was an important factor to consider in the design process of the Astro Nova website. Due to the whole topic of the website itself being around that of stars and the cosmos, imagery plays a vital role in encapsulating and grabbing the reader's attention. The main purpose is to immerse visitors when they visit the webpage into an atomosphere you that you created!
I decided to keep image background's the same on all pages, other than The AstroNova+ webpage, this was an intentional move as I wanted this page in particular to stand out from the other areas of the website, it was also important to select images that were in keeping with the design and colour scheme.


The images used on the website were sourced from:

- Both background images used were sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/),
- Logo was made by myself using [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/),
- All zodiac images were sourced from [All Free Downloads](https://all-free-download.com/) and then re-worked and designed by myself using [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/),
- 3 images from expert bio's were sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).


### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) - a wireframing software.

### Features

#### Current Features

The Astro Nova website consists of four main pages: Home, Experts, Horoscopes and AstroNova+ and two hidden pages that you are directed to upon completion of featured forms.

Some features run through all of them. These are:

- Page Logo - This includes the main page title (Astro Nova). Its black theme and design compliment the website design well, and the moon, planet and star graphics featured are fitting for the scope of the website. It appears on the top of every page within the website. It also works as a clickable link that will direct you back to the home page from any other page where featured
  
![Page Logo](documentation/logo.png)

- The navigation bar - This feature stretches across the entire width of the screen and consists of links to all four available pages of the website. It was created using Boostrap and is fully responsive, scaling down to a hamburger style menu when viewed on small devices. The active tab will display a white colour when selected for all webpages other than "AstroNova+" (this is styled differently to draw user attention) while the remaining three are muted. All links also change color when a user hovers over them.
  
![Navigation Bar](documentation/navbar.png)

- Alert & Modal - The Alert and Modal also feautures on all four main webpages and also stretches across the entire width of the screen. It consists of the centered text "SUBSCRIBE to our FREE Newsletter for exclusive offers and announcements..." followed by a fontawesome mail icon, when a user clicks the capitalized word "SUBSCRIBE" this toggles the Modal into action, when there a user can decide to Subscribe to AstroNova by inputting their email address followed by clicking the button labelled "Join Us!" this will direct a user to a new webpage (subscribed.html) to instruct the user that they have successfuly signed up.

![Alert & Modal](documentation/modal-view.png)
![Completed Subscription Form](documentation/completed-subscription.png)

- Page Footer - This also stretches across the entire width of the screen. It consists of styled social media links in the center as well as some copyright information just below. This is fully responsive. Social media icons change their colour to bright yellow when a user hovers over them.

![Page Footer](documentation/footer.png)


Home Page features:

- Jumbotron - The Jumbotron is the main focus and feature on the home page working as a direct call to action for new and visiting users, this adresses one of our main User Goals "To attract a higher level of premuim members through the + membership incentives." The Jumbotron was created using Bootstrap but has been fully styled with custom CSS. 

![Jumbotron](documentation/jumbotron.png)


- Clickable Icons - This section is made up of two columns (on larger screens) and four columns (on smaller screens). It features 12 clickable icons that direct you to the horoscopes.html webpage. Each icon is custom designed and has been styled. Each icon will appear muted in colour when a user hover over it. I thought this to be a fun and functional way that users right from the homepage can engage and navigate interactively through the website and think this would work effectively.

![Clickable Zoidac Icons](documentation/zodiac-icons.png)


Experts Page features:

- Introduction - A short introduction to the webpage prompting users to scroll down for further content. Headings have been styled simply with CSS, the h3 heading has been styled a shade of yellow to draw reader attention as well as the numbers "24/7" as a stand alone from the h5 heading, this addresses one of our user goals "To have an online presense which is both visually appealing and responsive which holds the ability for everybody to access and enjoy **at all times.**" 

![Experts Intro](documentation/experts-intro.png)

- Experts Profiles - This section is comprised of three seperate "Expert Profiles". Each profile has been styled with CSS, the profile image and relative text are both contained as one and have been given a dark grey background colour with a transparency of 0.5 to give the profile better clarity against the background image and improve user readability. A hr element has also been implemented and styled with CSS to create a yellow line divider between the expert profile name and bio.

![Expert Profiles](documentation/expert-profile.png)

- Mailto Link and Icon - Within each expert profile a mail icon has also been added this was sourced from website Fontawesome. These icons have been styled with CSS to change the size and colour and also have a hover effect. Each icon has been enclosed in a anchor tag that includes a Mailto link, when this is clicked by a user they will be directed to their email page or application where they will be able directly send an email of their own choosing to the related expert. This addresses one of our First time Visitor goals "To be able to easily access experts in the field all in one place that can be trusted."

![Mailto Link in action](documentation/mailto-link.png)

- Reviews Section - This section is comprised of two columns (larger screens) or four columns (smaller screens) in order to keep better responsive. Each review card has been styled with CSS, coloured yellow with a transparency of 0.25 and contain a speech icon sourced from website Fontawesome. 

![Review section](documentation/reviews.png)


Horoscopes Page features:

- Title and heading - Webpage title, with a short h3 heading that lets the user know the date's to which the content is related. Both styled with custom CSS.

![Horoscope Page. Title & Header](documentation/horoscopes_title-and-heading.png)

- Horoscope cards - This section includes 12 seperate cards, one for each sign of the zodiac. On large screens two cards occupy a single row wheresas to keep better responsive smaller devices will display each card stacked on top of one another. Each card has been sized a styled with CSS and is accompanied by the relevant zodiac icon.

![Horoscope card](documentation/horoscope-card.png)

- Horoscope card Button - Each card incorporates a button and every button tag has been given the  Bootstrap class name of "collapse", when a user selects the button this toggles the collapsable text into action. This method of displaying text makes accesibility to information easier and the webpage as a whole more managable as a user doesn't need to scroll through lots of text that isn't applicable to them. This feature therefore addresses one of our First time Visitor Goals "To navigate the website with ease, and access the simple information required quickly and without hassle."

![Horoscope card](documentation/button-collapse.png)


AstroNova + Page features:

- Title and heading - Webpage title, with a short h3 heading explaining free trial. Both heading elements have been styled to stand out behind the webpage background image and have been given a text-shadow CSS property.

![AstroNova+ Page. Title & Header](documentation/astronovaplus_title-and-heading.png)

- Checklist - A checklist has been added to accompany the above headings. This has been made with the use of tick icons sourced from the website FontAwesome and styled together with custom CSS to display an unordered list of incentives that could appeal to website users, this addresses one of our client goals "To attract a higher level of premuim members through the + membership incentives" All incentives have been grouped and styled in a semi-transparent box to grab user attention and improve user readability.

![Checklist](documentation/checklist.png)

- Form - The registration form is comprised of two text inputs, one password input, one date input and one checkbox input followed by a sumbit button. The form was created with Bootstrap classes but also has custom CSS. Submission of the form will allow the user to access Astro Nova with a premium membership and unlock all benefits. When the form is sumbitted successfully the user will be directed to a registration complete page that will thank them for joining AstroNova+. The form is easily readable free of background image and simple to follow which addresses one of our First time Visitor Goals "To be able to sign-up for memberships and newsletters quickly and simply."

![Form](documentation/form.png)
![Form](documentation/completed-form.png)


#### Future Features

Sign in Feature - to allow members to be able to access their accounts and benefits direct from the website. (to meet frequent user goal).

Message us feature - a working "message us" feature implemented in a form layout that can be used to actualy recieve and respond to user queries.

### Browser Compatibility

I have tested my deployed the AstroNova website on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/chrome_view.png) | Works as expected |
| Firefox | ![screenshot](documentation/firefox_view.png) | Works as expected |

| Opera | ![screenshot](documentation/opera_view.png) | Works as expected |

### Responsiveness

I have tested my deployed the AstroNova website on multiple device frames throughout it's creation to check for responsiveness issues. It appears to responds well to different screen sizes which ensures that users can access and navigate website content with ease regardless of the device they use.

| Device | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mobile (DevTools) | ![screenshot](documentation/mobile_view.png) | Works as expected |
| Tablet (DevTools) | ![screenshot](documentation/ipad_view.png) | Works as expected |


### Lighthouse Testing

I have tested my deployed project using the Lighthouse Audit tool to check for any major issues. Inital scores were quite low, because the website contained images in jpeg format. For this reason, I have converted all of my jpeg image files to webp format. It has greatly improved the performance.
