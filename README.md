# **ASTRO NOVA** - Milestone Project 1

Welcome to my First Milestone project, AstroNova.
So...I've taken a leap of faith and enrolled in a Full Stack Development course. Am I mad? Quite possibly! 
But I have high hopes to begin on a new journey to switch my career and become a programmer. Up to this point in my career, I have specialised mainly in Graphic Design, this is ultimately my passion, I love to be a creative and deliver quality work.
The ability to be able to merge these two visual mediums is both challenging and exciting for me.

The purpose of this project is to showcase my learning and understanding of the modules and the languages I have learned this far at this point in the course, while I still have much to learn, I hope you understand my vision.
I'd like to thank you for viewing my Milestone 1 project and I very much hope you enjoy it as much as I have designing and developing it!

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme chosen for the Astro Nova website I wanted to keep fairly simplistic. With the Genre of the website being that of space and the stars I knew very early on that I wanted to go for a "dark theme" however, I wanted to keep the website looking clean and fresh. For this reason I based my colour scheme predominantly around 2 different colour variations, Black and Yellow. I believe the common use of Blacks and Dark Greys contrasted well with the pops of bright Yellow. Using the variations of Yellow also allowed me select certain content throughout the website that I wanted to draw the readers attention to which works creatively. 

![Colour Palette](/documentation/colour-palette.png)
I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/000000-303030-484848-ffff00-cfcf4f) to generate my colour palette for the purpose of visual description.


### Typography

Because my main design vision for the Astro Nova Website was based around a clean and sleek visual I didn't feel it neccesary to overcomplicate when it came to selecting fonts. I wanted something professional looking that was also easy to read agianst the dark theme and imagery. I felt my selected font encompassed all I wanted it to, however I did decide to differentiate some heading elements from the main body text by experimenting with different font-weight's and also adding a text-shadow CSS property and believe this worked effectively while still staying on theme with the main body of content.

- The [Jost](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Jost?query=jost) font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans-serif as the fallback font. I sourced this from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icons were used throughout the site, such as the  moon icon and mail icons and also the social media icons found in the footer.


### Imagery

Imagery was an important factor to consider in the design process of the Astro Nova website. Due to the whole topic of the website itself being around that of stars and the cosmos, imagery plays a vital role in encapsulating and grabbing the reader's attention. The main purpose is to immerse visitors when they visit the webpage into an atomosphere you that you created!
I decided to keep image background's the same on all pages, other than The AstroNova+ webpage, this was an intentional move as I wanted this page in particular to stand out from the other areas of the website, it was also important to select images that were in keeping with the design and colour scheme.


The images used on the website were sourced from:

- Both background images used were sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/),
- Logo was made by myself using [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/),
- All zodiac images were sourced from [All Free Downloads](https://all-free-download.com/) and then re-worked and designed by myself using [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/),
- 3 images from expert bio's were sourced from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/).


### Wireframes

Wireframes were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) - a wireframing software.
