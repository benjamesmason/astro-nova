                            <p>Keep those proverbial purse strings tight! Money might start to get a little funny (but
                                not necessarily
                                amusing) this
                                Monday, September 4. That day, Jupiter, which is lucky and expansive in forward motion,
                                shifts into his
                                annual
                                four-month retrograde, this year in your financial sector. This isn’t cause to hit the
                                panic button,
                                however, Ram. Think
                                about it the way an economist would: as a natural “correction,” meaning getting things
                                back on a
                                realistic keel after
                                some carefree spending. If you’ve been living like there’s no tomorrow—or conveniently
                                forgetting that
                                you (at least
                                theoretically) have a budget—this U-turn may be a welcome event. No one expects your
                                freewheeling sign
                                to give up all
                                your luxuries, but you may learn new ways to indulge your high-end tastes that are more
                                resourceful than
                                paying full
                                retail. While wise Jupiter is back-spinning, you might come to enjoy sample sales and
                                upscale
                                consignment shops. To stay
                                motivated during this short-term belt-tightening cycle (through December 30), identify a
                                few big-ticket
                                goals for
                                yourself, from saving up for a new set of wheels next year to a winter vacation to a
                                down payment on a
                                home.</p>

                            <p>While you’re experimenting with new systems and processes, Aries, consider asking for
                                help when it’s
                                needed and not just
                                resorting to “doing it all by my damn self.” Wednesday’s quarter moon in cooperative
                                Gemini shines its
                                balancing beams
                                on your one-Ram show and reminds you that you’ll go farther faster with a little help
                                from your friends.
                                There are
                                potential collaborators who would make life easier (and more profitable)—but you’d have
                                to give them a
                                chance to show
                                you! This may be the moment where you lower the steel gates enough to let someone you’ve
                                known on a
                                casual level become
                                a bona fide project partner—or a true friend. On the other hand, you may realize that a
                                certain creative
                                partnership
                                effort has hit the point of diminishing returns. Heed this even-keeled quarter moon and
                                treat them the
                                way you’d want to
                                be treated (i.e., don’t just blow them off). But before you give up the ghost, why not
                                sit down for an
                                honest talk and
                                see if anything can be salvaged or improved upon. If not, at least you can move on with
                                positive regard
                                for each other.</p>

                            <p>If you’re not already in the habit of performing random acts of kindness, you might want
                                to start this
                                Friday, when
                                generous Jupiter (retrograde) in Taurus syncs up with the Virgo Sun in your sixth house
                                of service. Even
                                when it’s
                                back-pedaling, Jupiter invites abundance and luck—just with warnings to stay realistic.
                                Under these
                                warm-hearted beams,
                                it can literally pay to pay it forward. Lend a hand to a co-worker who’s clearly
                                overburdened; hold the
                                door for someone
                                carrying a load—or offer to help. No quid pro quos, either. When you give freely,
                                without expectation,
                                you show people
                                (and the universe) what you’re made of. As you probably know, true wealth is not
                                measured by how much
                                money you have in
                                the bank but by the richness of the relationships you have in your life.</p>

                            <p>With Jupiter supersizing everything in your life since it entered Taurus on May 16, you
                                may be getting used to this
                                newfound spaciousness. But this Monday, September 4, you may decide to re-examine some
                                of your exponential growth or
                                scale back. That’s because the cosmic titan begins its annual retrograde—this year
                                through your sign—until December 30.
                                It’s not bad news: Think of it as a useful “correction” in any areas where you’ve been
                                moving too fast or trying to cram
                                too much into one day or even week. It’s probably been thrilling, but also, if you’re
                                honest, a bit exhausting. Either
                                way, you might as well relish the slowdown and see it as a blessing in disguise. It’s
                                not a mandate to stop anything;
                                just to readjust the settings. If you do sit out a few events, you can proactively ward
                                off FOMO by scheduling
                                activities you never have time for, like a major home clean-up mission and donation
                                sweep. Catch up on your reading and
                                videos—with longtime friends, perhaps? And since retrogrades provide an opportunity to
                                reflect and review what’s on your
                                plate, you’ve got a golden opportunity to objectively reconsider your home,
                                relationship(s) and social obligations. Take
                                as much time as you need to figure out where you could cut back. If you think guidance
                                would help, bounce your ideas off
                                a close friend or maybe join a mastermind group focused on these very issues.</p>

                            <p>Wednesday’s restorative quarter moon in Gemini brings the stabilizing energy you’re
                                craving when it comes to your
                                finances and sense of security. Whether you’re fiscally fit or saddled with debt, you’ll
                                get a nudge to either tighten
                                the belt or maybe loosen it a couple notches and let yourself enjoy life’s finer good
                                things—a Taurus’ birthright!
                                Either way, the key is moderation. Hopefully you have some semblance of a budget and are
                                sticking to it. That’s always
                                the place to start. If you’re hoping for an infusion of capital or to curb spending,
                                prioritize that and then come up
                                with creative strategies. For instance, might your gym or yoga studio let you work some
                                front-desk hours to cover your
                                monthly membership? The barter system is great when cash isn’t flowing freely. And if
                                you have been saving
                                conscientiously, consider this a green light to treat yourself to something a little
                                luxe!</p>

                            <p>Get over any false modesty or self-doubts that are buzzing in your ear like an annoying
                                gnat! On Friday, auspicious
                                Jupiter—in Taurus—forms a supporting trine with the Virgo Sun in your fifth house of
                                romance, artistry and fame. Even
                                when it’s back-pedaling, Jupiter invites abundance and luck—just with warnings to stay
                                realistic. And because it only
                                spends a year in your sign every DECADE, this is one rare and lucky transit…so carpe
                                diem! What important piece of your
                                mission is still a work in progress? Where are you playing WAY too small? Take this
                                alignment as a cosmic thumbs up and
                                invest in your dreams. Since Jupiter rules travel and higher education, you might find

                            <p>Even though “action” could be your middle name, you may choose to sit out a few ragers
                                over the coming months as
                                expansive Jupiter begins its annual four-month retrograde on Monday, September 4. This

                                in Taurus and your twelfth house of rest, reflection and release. From now until
                                December 30, you’re better off
                                reviewing things you’ve already started rather than lunging into anything new. You may
                                find it helpful to think in terms
                                of “re” words, like retreat, recharge and recuperate! When you realize that burning the
                                candle at both ends doesn’t
                                provide more light—it just burns you out—you may actually welcome this retrograde with
                                open arms. And once you adjust to
                                this slowed-down pace, you may start moving in a more leisurely and connected manner and
                                attending to your personal
                                affairs, including meandering through your own daydreams. And when you realize that
                                these activities aren’t time-wasters
                                but necessary steps to healing and innovation, you might actually adopt this as your new
                                M.O.!</p>

                            <p>Another opportunity to come into inner balance arrives midweek courtesy of a quarter moon
                                in Gemini: halfway between new
                                and full. With these harmonizing moonbeams in your self-determining first house, you
                                might find the sweet spot between
                                independent and interdependent. Under this levelheaded quarter moon, you don’t have to
                                do anything drastic, like call an
                                abrupt end to a relationship. If you begin to understand that over-involvement in
                                certain connections actually deters
                                you from accomplishing your own goals, you may naturally reset the scales. If you don’t
                                have any etched-in-stone
                                obligations this Wednesday, make it a “me, myself and I” day and act like you’re on a
                                one-person retreat. Even if you
                                can only spare an hour or two, being fully engrossed in YOU will be its own reward.</p>

                            <p>Your nurturing side leads the way this Friday as big-hearted Jupiter, currently trekking
                                through your twelfth house of
                                rest, compassion and healing (and retrograde), aligns with the service-oriented Virgo
                                Sun. Even when it’s back-pedaling,
                                Jupiter expands everything it comes into contact with, and this configuration brings
                                your sentimental side to the fore.
                                Your style of caretaking is unique, Gemini: Rather than indulging people with empty
                                platitudes, you prefer to empower
                                them with words of support and wisdom. Of course, when it’s needed, you’re right there
                                with empathy and an extra-long
                                hug. But you’re not reluctant to point out where there’s “room for growth.” And this
                                week, that straightforwardness can
                                make a profound difference for someone you care about—for one thing, by NOT getting
                                sucked into a crisis-junkie’s
                                co-dependent trap. For your cerebral sign, nothing’s more frustrating than offering
                                suggestions to people who promptly
                                ignore you and proceed to do the same self-destructive things over and over again. Be
                                discerning and know when it’s most
                                appropriate to leave those texts on read.</p>

                            <p>Give a team effort one last big push on Monday, September 4! That’s the day that
                                supersizer Jupiter turns retrograde in
                                Taurus and your eleventh house of community and technology until December 30. It’s not
                                like you’ll have to endure four
                                months of mutinies and software fails, but your crew COULD lose momentum—or the mission
                                may slow down for reasons beyond
                                your control. That’s all the more reason to exert the effort. This way, regardless of
                                what happens over the next four
                                months, you’ll know you gave it your all. And if a project, friendship or membership in
                                an organization DOES unravel a
                                bit, don’t take it personally. You know that everything happens for a reason, and for
                                all you know, this could turn out
                                to be a blessing in disguise: the chance to wriggle out of something that’s not a good
                                fit or to revamp your game plan
                                and improve team communication. On the upside, over the next four months, you’ll gain a
                                new clarity about the kinds of
                                joint activities—and collaborators—that suit you best, both professionally and socially.
                                If you’ve bitten off more than
                                you can chew, this Jupiter retreat could inspire you to adopt a new mantra: “Quality
                                over quantity!”</p>

                            <p>This Wednesday, a quarter moon in Gemini shines its balancing beams into your mystical
                                twelfth house, serving a potent
                                reminder that there’s a LOT more to life than what meets the eye. As a sensitive Cancer,
                                you’re naturally intuitive and
                                often motivated by gut instincts and acute cases of feels. But most of the workaday
                                world gives more credence to
                                rational thinking than to emotional intelligence, which can cause you to devalue—or
                                doubt!—your own inner knowing. But
                                under Wednesday’s restorative moonbeams, you’re supported in letting your heart have an
                                equal say in all matters. And
                                then, why not adopt it as a regular practice? It’s true that feelings are not the same
                                as facts, but they are a valuable
                                compass, and as you get better at separating objective “truth” from personal beliefs (or
                                hopes or fears), your gut can
                                become a dependable guide! This is a great time to do some deep inner work to help you
                                make sense of it all, including
                                your dreams and “random” hits.</p>

                            <p>On Friday, abundant Jupiter forms a harmonious angle with the illuminating Sun, powering
                                up the most social zones of
                                your chart. As a security-oriented Cancer, you may be a creature of habit who strongly
                                prefers “safe” to “sorry.” But if
                                you sometimes feel like that is holding you back from experiencing life more fully, this
                                one-day transit can help you
                                overstep your self-imposed boundaries. Even when it’s back-pedaling, Jupiter brings luck
                                and invites expansion. Do you
                                keep seeing the same faces at every event? You know what they say about familiarity
                                breeding contempt, so it’s worth
                                your while to voluntarily stretch a bit outside your comfort zone. Being the stranger in
                                the room can feel awkward at
                                first but chat up the friendliest-looking faces until you eventually make your way to
                                the gatekeepers and decision
                                makers.</p>

                                checked in on how satisfied you are,
                                Leo? Then you will appreciate the universe’s involuntary slowdown order, AKA the
                                retrograde pivot of expansive Jupiter
                                in your career corner, that starts this Monday, September 4. The auspicious supersizer
                                has been pouring fuel into your
                                professional tanks since May 16, which may have led to a new job or taking on more
                                responsibility at the current one.
                                All well and good, but if you’ve been revving too high to pause and integrate the
                                lessons and adjust to the growth,
                                you’re missing the most valuable stuff! So this Jupiter U-turn—through December 30—is a
                                golden opportunity to take an
                                objective look at where you’re at, assess your progress and decide if this is the
                                direction you WANT to be heading in.
                                It’s easy to get swept along by momentum, but if you’ve gotten blown off course or want
                                to shift it, now’s your chance.
                                You may simply need to adjust your speed and possibly make a few corrections—or set off
                                on a totally new path in the new
                                year. This is also an opportune time to make contingency plans for delays and no-shows.
                                While you can’t control other
                                people’s behavior, you CAN make smart choices for best-case and worst-case scenarios
                                during this inward-turning transit.</p>

                            <p>Whichever direction turns out to be your chosen path, it’s unlikely you’ll be forging it
                                by yourself. You’re a social
                                creature by nature, Leo, and this Wednesday, a recalibrating quarter moon in Gemini and
                                your collaborative eleventh
                                house puts certain #SquadGoals up for review. What’s most important isn’t only how YOU
                                feel about the current mission
                                but how aligned the team is. No matter how enthusiastic you are, if other people aren’t
                                pulling their weight, you won’t
                                get the outcome you desire. This quarter moon offers an opportunity for a reality check:
                                How might you have played into
                                this dynamic? If you’ve been enabling the deadbeats by quietly picking up the slack,
                                it’s time to discuss motivation and
                                the lack thereof—AND the consequences. That said, if you’ve been the weak link in the
                                chain, own up and either recommit
                                to the project or respectfully let everyone know that it’s time for you to move on.</p>

                            <p>On Monday, September 4, you can start to objectively evaluate all those blue-sky visions
                                you’ve been crafting since
                                Jupiter blasted into Taurus and your expansive ninth house on May 16. This week, the
                                red-spotted titan shifts into
                                reverse for four months, bringing repeated opportunities for clear-eyed reality checks.
                                This isn’t the same thing as
                                having your bubble burst, Virgo! Your systematic and logical sign moves cautiously. But
                                Jupiter can overfill your
                                confidence tanks and plant grandiose notions in your otherwise sensible brain. Think of
                                this time—and any slowdowns or
                                reversals it brings—as a necessary course correction; a chance to see what’s realistic
                                versus what belongs in the
                                “wishful-thinking” category. Take these next four months (until December 30) to review
                                what’s on the table, make
                                necessary adjustments and hatch a solid plan to turn your big ideas into something
                                concrete. Since the ninth house rules
                                travel and adventure, you might decide to revisit a place that’s held special
                                significance for you. One caveat: Don’t
                                expect to have the same experience twice!</p>

                            <p>As you make the most of the last fleeting days of summer fun and prolong the
                                birthday-season celebrations, your thoughts
                                might start to drift to Q4 career goals. Thanks to Wednesday’s restorative quarter moon
                                in Gemini shining its balancing
                                beams into your professional tenth house, your ambition will begin to mount. Hard work
                                and devotion are not a problem
                                for you, Virgo; the challenge could be deciding which of your myriad interests deserve
                                the lion’s share of your energy
                                and attention. Many Virgos are the jack or jill of all trades. Now the question is, what
                                do you want to truly master?
                                There isn’t a “right” answer—or even a “better” path—and that can be liberating! Your
                                service-oriented sign knows that
                                if you throw your heart and soul into something you love doing, you can’t go wrong. If
                                you’re self-employed,
                                “back-to-school” September might be the time to increase your rates or talk to the
                                powers that be at work about a raise.
                                Research industry standards for fees and salaries among your peers to make sure you’re
                                pricing yourself
                                competitively—and making enough to keep your people fed and happy!</p>

                            <p>How do you REALLY feel, Virgo? It’s time to stop being diplomatic and let the world know
                                what’s kicking around in your
                                gray matter. On Friday, the Sun in your sign and empowered first house gets a signal
                                boost from intrepid,
                                straightforward Jupiter. Even when it’s back-pedaling, Jupiter widens your perspective,
                                brings luck and reminds you to
                                manage your expectations. If you don’t let people know what you are feeling, how will
                                they be able to interact
                                appropriately or lend support if that’s what’s needed? Of course, candor doesn’t have to
                                be delivered with a truth
                                hammer. You can simply express your opinion or offer feedback without any snark. If your
                                intention is to rile people up,
                                then go ahead and be an incendiary firestarter. But then what? If you know your desired
                                outcome, set yourself up for
                                success by having a “call to action” ready. The crowds will be happy to follow you
                                wherever you lead, so take them to a
                                meaningful destination.</p>

                            <p>Expansive Jupiter has been turning your attention to intimate and erotic affairs ever
                                since entering Taurus and your
                                private eighth house this past May 16. But starting on Monday, September 4, things could
                                take a turn for the VERY
                                subterranean when the supersizing planet plunges into retrograde for the next four
                                months (until December 30). This
                                annual reversal will turn you inward, making you less interested in the obvious than
                                what’s simmering below the surface.
                                Party invites may pale compared to time spent alone or with a special someone. In your
                                eighth house, Jupiter retrograde
                                can help you set some new depth records! Its intensifying influence can strengthen your
                                relationships and make
                                commitment seem urgent—OR some Libras may discover they need a longer leash to explore
                                more options. If your partnership
                                isn’t affected, you might start rethinking your spiritual beliefs. You’ll be in full-on
                                seeker mode, but because Jupiter
                                doesn’t play by half-measure, you may quickly be overwhelmed by too many options—not a
                                good thing for a
                                decision-challenged Libra! Eliminate everything that’s not a strong contender, then
                                check out one smart and savvy
                                prospect at a time, being guided by the principle, “If you want to grow, you’ve got to
                                let go.”</p>

                            <p>If you start to feel like you’re in over your head, just call a timeout and arrange for a
                                change of scenery this
                                Wednesday. A restorative quarter moon in Gemini offers a chance to clear your mental
                                cache and hit refresh on the
                                internal dialogue. This moon cycle is activating your ninth house of wider horizons and
                                expanded vision, so whether or
                                not you’ve got a case of wanderlust, unfamiliar vistas—or venues—will be highly
                                stimulating now. But don’t add to any
                                pressure by trying to score last-minute discounted deals. Keep it simple! Plan a day
                                trip (for now or the weekend) and
                                pack some extra clothes just in case an exciting opportunity crops up. Don’t force
                                anything, Libra: By keeping an open
                                mind (and eyes), you may find that after a full day of exploring, you’re so content that
                                all you want is to drift into
                                sweet slumber in your own bed.</p>

                            <p>By the time the weekend rolls around, you’ll be wide-open and ready to bond. On Friday,
                                big-hearted Jupiter in Taurus
                                forms a supportive angle with the Virgo Sun in your mystical and compassionate twelfth
                                house. Even when retrograde,
                                Jupiter brings abundance and luck—just with warnings to keep expectations realistic.
                                Single? A relationship that’s been
                                on simmer could heat up fast under this seductive pairing. And with “say anything”
                                Jupiter in the equation, small talk
                                could quickly evolve into a deep-diving swapping of secrets—from childhood hurts to some
                                very private fantasies. Coupled
                                Libra may embark on something new together, anything from a joint business venture to a
                                co-signed lease. You’ll see the
                                advantage of dropping your guard, especially around people you trust and admire.
                                Powerful (and lasting) shifts can occur
                                this week if you seek out intriguing people AND consciously create a fertile space to

                                Jupiter commences a four-month

                                Whether you’re single, attached or drifting through a situationship, this is a perfect
                                opportunity to step back and gain
                                enough perspective to look at things with an objective eye. Jupiter is the truth-teller
                                of the zodiac, and during its
                                annual reversal, you’ll have plenty of chances to look at ALL the stories you tell
                                yourself and, if needed and desired,
                                to make necessary course corrections, which is actually the perfect thing to do during
                                retrogrades. Couples should find
                                time to sit down together to talk things through and get back in sync. But don’t
                                approach bae when one of you is
                                stressed with a work deadline or dealing with a fraught family issue. Single? The
                                galactic giant has been widening your
                                partnership parameters since entering this realm on May 16. Now, during this pivot, you
                                can experiment with different
                                approaches to dating, including saying yes to some surprising types. The only real
                                caveat with Jupiter back-spinning is
                                to not overindulge or proceed with something TOO quickly.</p>

                            <p>On Wednesday, a balancing quarter moon falls in your private eighth house, inspiring you
                                to review files and documents
                                on your hard drive and in the cloud (and maybe tucked away in a drawer) and decide what
                                if anything needs to be made
                                even more secure. Start with your password-protected sites: Are those passwords strong
                                enough? Have you been a bit too
                                revealing on social media—or if you’ve been TOO mysterious, this lunar lift could nudge
                                you to share a little more.
                                These empowering moonbeams might bring a surge of momentum to tackle a messy area of
                                your life, whether that’s literal
                                clutter, a disorganized digital life or over-booked calendar. Take clear measures, but
                                don’t replace one extreme with
                                another!</p>

                            <p>On Friday, larger-than-life Jupiter forms a harmonious trine (120-degree angle) with the
                                illuminating Sun, activating
                                two of your most social and people-oriented chart sectors. While auspicious, the energy
                                of this sync-up won’t last long,
                                so strike while the iron is hot! Don’t worry about Jupiter being retrograde: Even when
                                in reverse, Jupiter is associated
                                with abundance and luck. The catch is managing your expectations! This is a great time
                                to double down on networking
                                efforts or, if you’re recruiting members for the Scorpio dream team, to cast an
                                extra-wide net by reaching out to past
                                and present connections in your contact database and showing up everywhere you’re
                                invited. You literally never know who
                                you’ll meet at that industry event or casual group hang.</p>

                            <p>No shortcuts! Starting this Monday, September 4, your galactic guardian, Professor
                                Jupiter, will be spinning retrograde
                                in your sixth house of work and service until December 30. While you can accomplish
                                much, your success will come from
                                dotting every “i” and crossing every “t”—not from cutting corners or doing things by
                                half measure. Your larger-than-life
                                sign paints in broad strokes, but with your ruler trekking through your sixth house of
                                details and precision, what may
                                be needed is a recalibration. During this annual four-month backspin—this year in Taurus
                                and your systematic sixth
                                house—you may come to learn firsthand that the destination is less important than the
                                journey. So if you encounter
                                delays, reversals or circuitous detours, know that they’re not inconveniences to be
                                overcome but important experiences
                                cosmically designed to help you grow. Whatever you’re engaged in, be it a work or
                                personal project, stay focused on the
                                process, however repetitive or laborious it may be. Resisting the urge to jump ship or
                                outsource key sections will
                                deepen your connection to your vision. Trust that Jupiter the teacher has some big
                                lessons for you. And when things are
                                done to your satisfaction, you’ll come away with a sense of pride and achievement that
                                couldn’t have come any other way.</p>

                            <p>Wednesday’s quarter moon in Gemini shines its beams into your seventh house of committed
                                partnerships, inspiring you to
                                restore balance to a key relationship. You don’t have to go to the mats with this
                                person, but you need a clear read on
                                the situation or dynamics that knocked things out of equilibrium. You may become aware
                                of just how much more weight
                                you’ve been carrying or that your other half is a great sharer but not a good listener.
                                Or possibly you could recognize
                                that your generosity is bordering on enabling—or trying to buy affection or loyalty. In
                                order to regain parity you might
                                have to give up some control or acknowledge that you’ve been taking someone’s quiet (yet
                                staunch) support for granted.
                                Don’t wait one more second to rectify that oversight. Let this generous soul know how
                                much you appreciate everything
                                they’ve done for you—and opt for a gesture more meaningful than sending a text!</p>

                            <p>On Friday, your focus returns to your own career ambitions. Thanks to a rare and
                                empowering trine between the courageous
                                Sun and Jupiter the gambler, business dealings could accelerate at a rapid clip. Even
                                when it’s back-pedaling, Jupiter
                                brings abundance and luck—along with warnings to keep your expectations realistic.
                                Opportunities for advancement abound;
                                the question is, what direction do you want to head in? You could respond to what you
                                observe, say, an opening at your
                                current place of employment to step into a position of greater leadership. Or maybe
                                you’re ready to create your own
                                dream job, whether within the company or by going off on your own or with a business
                                partner. In any event, turn on your
                                charisma and let appropriate players know your interests. And since Jupiter rules travel
                                and higher learning, perhaps a
                                trip that includes training makes sense for Q4, especially if it could bump you into a
                                higher income bracket!</p>

                            <p>Just as a budding relationship or creative project is getting traction, things might slow
                                down starting this Monday,
                                September 4. That’s because amplifying Jupiter, which has been expanding romantic and
                                artistic initiatives since May 16,
                                shifts into its annual four-month retrograde, threatening delays. Frustrating as that
                                may be, don’t try to force
                                progress if it’s not flowing. Luckily, you’re a disciplined Capricorn who’s accustomed
                                to riding out situations like
                                this. This year’s pivot is happening in Taurus and your amorous, glamorous fifth house.
                                In forward motion, Jupiter can
                                quickly spark actions that feel larger than life and extra dramatic. But backward, his
                                effect is exactly the opposite.
                                The red-spotted titan is also the truth-teller of the skies, and if you can drop your
                                defenses and really listen, there
                                might be some valuable lessons. Whether you like what you’re hearing or not, these
                                reality checks can bring clarity. And
                                since retrogrades rule the past, you might give someone from your “back list” a second
                                chance. But wait for Jupiter to
                                resume forward motion on December 30 to make any formal announcements!</p>

                            <p>Even with certain projects on hold, you’ll catch a cosmic tailwind on Wednesday to bring
                                order to the Capricorn court,
                                courtesy of a quarter moon in Gemini and your sixth house of systems, organization, work
                                and service. This balancing
                                lunar phase can guide you to get things decluttered and streamlined. You know where you
                                currently ARE, but do you know
                                where you want to BE? That decision is fundamental to everything else, and once you’ve
                                got it sorted out—or at least
                                have a good idea of your desired destination—sit down and map out a possible route,
                                working your way backward from the
                                finish line to where you are now. What milestones would you like to hit along the way?
                                Then evaluate: What human and
                                financial resources are needed to get you up and running? Once you gain a little
                                traction, you’ll be amazed by how
                                doable it will feel. Before your head hits the pillow, take at least one concrete step,
                                like submitting an inquiry or
                                reaching out to someone who might be the perfect collaborator!</p>

                            <p>You’ll be firing on all cylinders this Friday under a sizzling sync-up of the luminous
                                Sun and boundless Jupiter. Even
                                when it’s back-pedaling, Jupiter brings luck—and can whet your appetite for experiences
                                you never seriously considered
                                in the past. This is a day to widen ALL your horizons, even if you don’t actually commit
                                to anything yet. But by keeping
                                your mind wide open and increasing your risk tolerance (at least a little), you could
                                burst through “barriers” and
                                limitations that were never actually real in the first place. Because the Sun is in your
                                horizon-widening ninth house,
                                you may hop on a literal plane for a mission or for love—or you might sign up for a
                                foreign language or have a
                                meaningful cross-cultural interaction. Whenever you get a choice, opt for being slightly
                                over-the-top rather than
                                dutifully drab and diligent!</p>[]

                                of family and roots on May 16, and ever since, these areas of life have been filled with
                                activity. Now, with amplifying
                                Jupiter powered down, you’ll appreciate fewer demands on your schedule. Set limits with

                                status, you can call in—or bring
                                back—those loving feelings. Start by setting an intention for your love life, whether
                                that’s meeting someone with keeper
                                potential, ending a going-nowhere situationship or taking a major next step with bae.
                                Then do something to evoke the
                                spirit of Eros—to reacquaint yourself with your inner seductrix—like going dancing or
                                getting a spa treatment to feel
                                luxurious in your skin. If you haven’t had enough quality time with the object of your
                                affection, don’t waste the
                                precious moments you DO have together harping or complaining. Instead, make your next
                                “we time” as fun and exciting as
                                possible. Since this quarter moon is in your house of “celebrity,” be prepared for your
                                15 minutes of fame by selecting
                                one or two fierce and head-turning outfits that only you could pull off.</p>

                                subtlety will win you more fans than
                                unabashed flirtation. That’s the beauty of the expansive planet traveling in reverse.
                                But don’t pull too far back or
                                play TOO hard to get! Master the fine art of the slow, steady gaze, a hallmark of
                                confidence. A glance and a seductive
                                smile should do the trick. This auspicious angle can beckon the interior-decorating muse

                            <p>Watch what comes out of your mouth—and typing fingers—starting this Monday, September 4,
                                as outspoken Jupiter flips into
                                retrograde. The blunt, supersizer planet has been in (normally circumspect) Taurus and
                                your communication sector since
                                May 16, helping you think outside the box in areas where you might be unnecessarily
                                limiting yourself. But in reverse,
                                Jupiter can be responsible for unrealistic expectations and sticking a foot in your
                                mouth. This is why you should think
                                twice before you broach any sensitive topics. Jupiter is associated with legal affairs,
                                so make sure that important
                                agreements you THOUGHT were chiseled in stone actually are. While you can’t control
                                others’ actions, you are responsible
                                for what you say and do. And with Jupiter spinning backward in your communication
                                sector, you could be susceptible to
                                some awkward “Did I really just say that?!” moments between now and December 30. The
                                upside is that with Jupiter
                                back-pedaling, you could find yourself with some free time on your hands, which would be
                                the perfect opportunity for you
                                to revisit a project like writing poetry or starting a podcast.</p>

                            <p>On Wednesday, a balancing quarter moon in Gemini and your foundational fourth house can
                                help you distinguish fact from
                                feeling—a valuable lesson for an emo water sign! This can be useful if you’ve been
                                overreacting to the way someone’s
                                been treating you. Rather than second-guess yourself—or the other person—screw up your
                                nerve to initiate a conversation
                                about how you both are feeling. Even solid relationships require periodic
                                recalibrations. No need to be ominous (or
                                terrified). Just invite them to sit down over a cup of tea and catch up. After a quick
                                small-talk warm-up, address your
                                feelings by speaking in “I language”—and remember to ask THEM questions. In other words,
                                Pisces, extend the benefit of
                                the doubt and set the stage for an honest dialogue. These restorative moonbeams might
                                also prompt a home decor update.
                                But easy does it. Pick one under-utilized zone and turn it into something dreamy AND
                                functional!</p>

                            <p>People are your most valuable resource this Friday as the illuminating Sun syncs up with
                                horizon-expanding Jupiter in a
                                lucky trine (120-degree angle) in your houses of communication and relationship. It’s
                                hardly breaking news that the
                                conversations you’re exposed to on a regular basis influence your perspective on life,
                                which isn’t a bad thing. But for
                                everyone’s sake, step out of that echo chamber and let your innate curiosity lead the
                                way. In other words, mix up all
                                the input you’re receiving, from social media chatter to “hard news” to chitchat among
                                friends. With Jupiter powering up
                                your local activities zone, you could stumble upon some fascinating individuals and
                                groups practically in your back
                                yard. And remember: Talking (and listening!) to people who think differently than you
                                doesn’t mean you’re going to
                                abandon your beliefs—or principles! In fact, under this expansive alignment, dialogues
                                might yield creative solutions.
                                This could be the start of a sparkling synergy, Pisces, even if the two of you make a
                                total odd couple.</p>
