                    <p>Keep those proverbial purse strings tight! Money might start to get a little funny (but not necessarily
                        amusing) this
                        Monday, September 4. That day, Jupiter, which is lucky and expansive in forward motion, shifts into his
                        annual
                        four-month retrograde, this year in your financial sector. This isn’t cause to hit the panic button,
                        however, Ram. Think
                        about it the way an economist would: as a natural “correction,” meaning getting things back on a
                        realistic keel after
                        some carefree spending. If you’ve been living like there’s no tomorrow—or conveniently forgetting that
                        you (at least
                        theoretically) have a budget—this U-turn may be a welcome event. No one expects your freewheeling sign
                        to give up all
                        your luxuries, but you may learn new ways to indulge your high-end tastes that are more resourceful than
                        paying full
                        retail. While wise Jupiter is back-spinning, you might come to enjoy sample sales and upscale
                        consignment shops. To stay
                        motivated during this short-term belt-tightening cycle (through December 30), identify a few big-ticket
                        goals for
                        yourself, from saving up for a new set of wheels next year to a winter vacation to a down payment on a
                        home.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>While you’re experimenting with new systems and processes, Aries, consider asking for help when it’s
                        needed and not just
                        resorting to “doing it all by my damn self.” Wednesday’s quarter moon in cooperative Gemini shines its
                        balancing beams
                        on your one-Ram show and reminds you that you’ll go farther faster with a little help from your friends.
                        There are
                        potential collaborators who would make life easier (and more profitable)—but you’d have to give them a
                        chance to show
                        you! This may be the moment where you lower the steel gates enough to let someone you’ve known on a
                        casual level become
                        a bona fide project partner—or a true friend. On the other hand, you may realize that a certain creative
                        partnership
                        effort has hit the point of diminishing returns. Heed this even-keeled quarter moon and treat them the
                        way you’d want to
                        be treated (i.e., don’t just blow them off). But before you give up the ghost, why not sit down for an
                        honest talk and
                        see if anything can be salvaged or improved upon. If not, at least you can move on with positive regard
                        for each other.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>If you’re not already in the habit of performing random acts of kindness, you might want to start this
                        Friday, when
                        generous Jupiter (retrograde) in Taurus syncs up with the Virgo Sun in your sixth house of service. Even
                        when it’s
                        back-pedaling, Jupiter invites abundance and luck—just with warnings to stay realistic. Under these
                        warm-hearted beams,
                        it can literally pay to pay it forward. Lend a hand to a co-worker who’s clearly overburdened; hold the
                        door for someone
                        carrying a load—or offer to help. No quid pro quos, either. When you give freely, without expectation,
                        you show people
                        (and the universe) what you’re made of. As you probably know, true wealth is not measured by how much
                        money you have in
                        the bank but by the richness of the relationships you have in your life.</p>

                            goals for
                            yourself, from saving up for a new set of wheels next year to a winter vacation to a down payment on a

                        <p>While you’re experimenting with new systems and processes, Aries, consider asking for help when it’s
                            needed and not just
                            resorting to “doing it all by my damn self.” Wednesday’s quarter moon in cooperative Gemini shines its
                            balancing beams
                            on your one-Ram show and reminds you that you’ll go farther faster with a little help from your friends.
                            There are
                            potential collaborators who would make life easier (and more profitable)—but you’d have to give them a
                            chance to show
                            you! This may be the moment where you lower the steel gates enough to let someone you’ve known on a
                            casual level become
                            a bona fide project partner—or a true friend. On the other hand, you may realize that a certain creative
                            partnership
                            effort has hit the point of diminishing returns. Heed this even-keeled quarter moon and treat them the
                            way you’d want to
                            be treated (i.e., don’t just blow them off). But before you give up the ghost, why not sit down for an
                            honest talk and
                            see if anything can be salvaged or improved upon. If not, at least you can move on with positive regard

                            Friday, when
                            generous Jupiter (retrograde) in Taurus syncs up with the Virgo Sun in your sixth house of service. Even
                            when it’s
                            back-pedaling, Jupiter invites abundance and luck—just with warnings to stay realistic. Under these
                            warm-hearted beams,
                            it can literally pay to pay it forward. Lend a hand to a co-worker who’s clearly overburdened; hold the
                            door for someone
                            carrying a load—or offer to help. No quid pro quos, either. When you give freely, without expectation,
                            you show people
                            (and the universe) what you’re made of. As you probably know, true wealth is not measured by how much
                            money you have in

                            four-month retrograde, this year in your financial sector. This isn’t cause to hit the panic button,
                            however, Ram. Think
                            about it the way an economist would: as a natural “correction,” meaning getting things back on a
                            realistic keel after
                            some carefree spending. If you’ve been living like there’s no tomorrow—or conveniently forgetting that
                            you (at least
                            theoretically) have a budget—this U-turn may be a welcome event. No one expects your freewheeling sign
                            to give up all
                            your luxuries, but you may learn new ways to indulge your high-end tastes that are more resourceful than
                            paying full
                            retail. While wise Jupiter is back-spinning, you might come to enjoy sample sales and upscale
                            consignment shops. To stay
                            motivated during this short-term belt-tightening cycle (through December 30), identify a few big-ticket
                            goals for
                            yourself, from saving up for a new set of wheels next year to a winter vacation to a down payment on a
                            home.</p>

                        <p>While you’re experimenting with new systems and processes, Aries, consider asking for help when it’s
                            needed and not just
                            resorting to “doing it all by my damn self.” Wednesday’s quarter moon in cooperative Gemini shines its
                            balancing beams
                            on your one-Ram show and reminds you that you’ll go farther faster with a little help from your friends.
                            There are
                            potential collaborators who would make life easier (and more profitable)—but you’d have to give them a
                            chance to show
                            you! This may be the moment where you lower the steel gates enough to let someone you’ve known on a
                            casual level become
                            a bona fide project partner—or a true friend. On the other hand, you may realize that a certain creative
                            partnership
                            effort has hit the point of diminishing returns. Heed this even-keeled quarter moon and treat them the
                            way you’d want to
                            be treated (i.e., don’t just blow them off). But before you give up the ghost, why not sit down for an
                            honest talk and
                            see if anything can be salvaged or improved upon. If not, at least you can move on with positive regard
                            for each other.</p>

                        <p>If you’re not already in the habit of performing random acts of kindness, you might want to start this
                            Friday, when
                            generous Jupiter (retrograde) in Taurus syncs up with the Virgo Sun in your sixth house of service. Even
                            when it’s
                            back-pedaling, Jupiter invites abundance and luck—just with warnings to stay realistic. Under these
                            warm-hearted beams,
                            it can literally pay to pay it forward. Lend a hand to a co-worker who’s clearly overburdened; hold the
                            door for someone
                            carrying a load—or offer to help. No quid pro quos, either. When you give freely, without expectation,
                            you show people
                            (and the universe) what you’re made of. As you probably know, true wealth is not measured by how much
                            money you have in
                            the bank but by the richness of the relationships you have in your life.</p>

                            yourself, from saving up for a new set of wheels next year to a winter vacation to a down payment on a

                        <p>While you’re experimenting with new systems and processes, Aries, consider asking for help when it’s
                            needed and not just
                            resorting to “doing it all by my damn self.” Wednesday’s quarter moon in cooperative Gemini shines its
                            balancing beams
                            on your one-Ram show and reminds you that you’ll go farther faster with a little help from your friends.
                            There are
                            potential collaborators who would make life easier (and more profitable)—but you’d have to give them a
                            chance to show
                            you! This may be the moment where you lower the steel gates enough to let someone you’ve known on a
                            casual level become
                            a bona fide project partner—or a true friend. On the other hand, you may realize that a certain creative
                            partnership
                            effort has hit the point of diminishing returns. Heed this even-keeled quarter moon and treat them the
                            way you’d want to
                            be treated (i.e., don’t just blow them off). But before you give up the ghost, why not sit down for an
                            honest talk and
                            see if anything can be salvaged or improved upon. If not, at least you can move on with positive regard
                            for each other.</p>

                            Friday, when
                            generous Jupiter (retrograde) in Taurus syncs up with the Virgo Sun in your sixth house of service. Even
                            when it’s
                            back-pedaling, Jupiter invites abundance and luck—just with warnings to stay realistic. Under these
                            warm-hearted beams,
                            it can literally pay to pay it forward. Lend a hand to a co-worker who’s clearly overburdened; hold the
                            door for someone
                            carrying a load—or offer to help. No quid pro quos, either. When you give freely, without expectation,
                            you show people
                            (and the universe) what you’re made of. As you probably know, true wealth is not measured by how much
                            money you have in
                            the bank but by the richness of the relationships you have in your life.</p>
